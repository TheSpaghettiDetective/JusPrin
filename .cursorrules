# Glob Pattern for Unit Tests Folder
tests/unit/*

# Rules for tests/unit/*

If you are working on files in the tests/unit/ folder, you are working making unit tests pass. Follow these rules:

## Resolving dependencies

- Find how the main project's dependencies are established by analyzing @file/build_release_macos.sh. Remember, the source code in the `src` folder should already have all dependencies resolved by @file/build_release_macos.sh
- Use the dependencies established by running `./build_release_macos.sh -d`
- Do NOT try to install and use system dependencies

## Compile errors

- The source code in the `src` folder should already compile. So if there are compile errors for the source file in the `src` folder, ALWAYS ask for confirmation before you change them.
- If the compile errors are for the tests/unit/* unit test files, you should change them without asking for confirmation
